Problem
=======

Need for R/C++ api
------------------

The success of `Rcpp` (Eddelbuettel and François 2011) is a great testimony of the need within the R 
community to have solid foundations to use R together with C++. A significant subset of R packages
use of Rcpp to leverage C++ code, and this extends to a large proportion of packages once
recursive reverse dependencies are taken into account. 

Towards more recent C++ standards
---------------------------------

However ubiquitous, the current implementation of `Rcpp` is maintained with emphasis on interface stability 
and backwards compatibility against old versions of C++, namely `C++98`. Before the release of `C++11`, the language had been 
stagnant for a long period of time. Adoption of modern C++ standards (from `C++11`) by compiler providers has 
taken additional time, and availability of these compilers accross relevant platforms suitable for R development 
took further time. 

The completed modernization of the `Rtools` suite for windows set an important milestone about 
availability of modern C++ standards. When developping modern R packages using C++ code, we can now 
safely assume C++11. Furthermore, transitionning from C++11 to more recent versions should 
be less of a struggle. 

Backwards compatibility with C++98 may initially perceived as a good feature, but in effect it is
our belief that it is in fact a curse in disguise. It forces developpers of the R/C++ bridge as well 
as developpers to dependent packages to maintain code targetting both modern syntax (using features such as lambdas 
and the `auto` keyword) and outdated C++ idioms. In effect, this leads to conditionnal compiling and 
therefore code bloat. 

We suggest eliminating this issue altogether by rebasing the R/C++ api codebase on more recent 
C++ standards. Initially we are interested in C++11 which is now universally available 
on the platforms of interest for R package development. 

This allows both the api as well as packages using it to take full advantage of modern C++ syntax, 
leading to better code clarity and concision. For example, large parts of the historic `Rcpp` codebase
are written by means of automatically generated R code that adds thousands of lines of C++ code, 
which can be rewritten using variadic templates in much less code.

Runtime dependency
------------------

The current implementation of the R/C++ api is distributed as an R package containing 
both header files for api classes (e.g. `NumericVector`) and a runtime library that is either 
dynamically or statically linked depending on the platform. 

This separation may cause hurdles between the two translation units involved, which makes 
exception propagation more difficult that it could be. 

Furthermore, the bigger problem is with updates of the api and potential binary 
incompatibilities. When developping a package that uses `Rcpp`, several versions of the 
codebase are involved. 
  - The version of `Rcpp` used by the developper of the package
  - The version of `Rcpp` on CRAN, used i.e. to compile binary versions of the package
  - The version of `Rcpp` on the user's machine
  
When these 3 versions are the same, everything works fine. When they start to differ, 
complicated to deal with binary incompatibility problems start to happen. Package developpers
have used various degrees of safeguards to limit the issue, for example always depend on the 
latest version of `Rcpp` but this is far from fullproof. 

These issues are hard to find and even harder to deal with. The smallest change in the 
api can trigger the problem. The maintainers of `Rcpp` are well aware of it, and have chosen
to deal with it by limiting the number of api changes to a strict minimum, making it
extremely difficult to let the api evolve, and for example come back on some eearly design 
mistakes. 

Our envisionned solution to work around this issue is twofold:
  - The api will exclusively provide header files. 
  - The api will be distributed in a way that makes it embeddable in the client package. A client 
    package will consist on original code using headers of the api that will be stored somewhere 
    within the package
    
With these two design conditions, the version of the api used for a package is the same accross 
all scenarios. The version of the api used on the installed package of some user is the same
as the version of the api used by the cran package, which is also the same as the version of the 
api that has been used to develop the package. 

Ugrading to a newer version of the api becomes the responsability of the developper of the 
client package. This will dramatically reduce binary incompatibility issues. 

This distribution model gives developpers of the R/C++ api much more latitude to make 
potentially breaking changes, eliminate dead code or simply redesign parts of the api
that deserve it. 

Modularity
----------

Currently, when using `Rcpp`, we include all of the code base with `#include <Rcpp.h>`, 
this pulls in all of the code base, including api classes, sugar and modules. However 
sometimes only a limited fraction of the codebase is effectively used. For example
some code might only use numeric vectors. 

We will look at solutions allowing to extract only the relevant part of the api
for the target use.
