Problem
=======

Need for R/C++ api
------------------

The success of `Rcpp` (Eddelbuettel and François 2011) is a great testimony of the need within the R 
community to have solid foundations to use R together with C++. A significant subset of R packages
use of Rcpp to leverage C++ code, and this extends to a large proportion of packages once
recursive reverse dependencies are taken into account. 

Towards more recent C++ standards
---------------------------------

However ubiquitous, the current implementation of `Rcpp` is maintained with emphasis on interface stability 
and backwards compatibility against old versions of C++, namely `C++98`. Before the release of `C++11`, the language had been 
stagnant for a long period of time. Adoption of modern C++ standards (from `C++11`) by compiler providers has 
taken additional time, and availability of these compilers accross relevant platforms suitable for R development 
took further time. 

The completed modernization of the `Rtools` (Murdoch, Ligges, Kou, Ushey, Allaire, Adler and Ooms 2016)
suite for windows set an important milestone about 
availability of modern C++ standards. When developping modern R packages using C++ code, we can now 
safely assume C++11. Furthermore, transitionning from C++11 to more recent versions should 
be less of a struggle. 

Backwards compatibility with C++98 may initially perceived as a good feature, but in effect it is
our belief that it is in fact a curse in disguise. It forces developpers of the R/C++ bridge as well 
as developpers to dependent packages to maintain code targetting both modern syntax (using features such as lambdas 
and the `auto` keyword) and outdated C++ idioms. In effect, this leads to conditionnal compiling and 
therefore code bloat. 

We suggest eliminating this issue altogether by rebasing the R/C++ api codebase on more recent 
C++ standards. Initially we are interested in C++11 which is now universally available 
on the platforms of interest for R package development. 

This allows both the api as well as packages using it to take full advantage of modern C++ syntax, 
leading to better code clarity and concision. For example, large parts of the historic `Rcpp` codebase
are written by means of automatically generated R code that adds thousands of lines of C++ code, 
which can be rewritten using variadic templates in much less code.

Runtime dependency
------------------

The current implementation of the R/C++ api is distributed as an R package containing 
both header files for api classes (e.g. `NumericVector`) and a runtime library that is either 
dynamically or statically linked depending on the platform. 

This separation may cause hurdles between the two translation units involved, which makes 
exception propagation more difficult that it could be. 

Furthermore, the bigger problem is with updates of the api and potential binary 
incompatibilities. When developping a package that uses `Rcpp`, several versions of the 
codebase are involved. 
  - The version of `Rcpp` used by the developper of the package
  - The version of `Rcpp` on CRAN, used i.e. to compile binary versions of the package
  - The version of `Rcpp` on the user's machine
  
When these 3 versions are the same, everything works fine. When they start to differ, 
complicated to deal with binary incompatibility problems start to happen. Package developpers
have used various degrees of safeguards to limit the issue, for example always depend on the 
latest version of `Rcpp` but this is far from fullproof. 

These issues are hard to find and even harder to deal with. The smallest change in the 
api can trigger the problem. The maintainers of `Rcpp` are well aware of it, and have chosen
to deal with it by limiting the number of api changes to a strict minimum, making it
extremely difficult to let the api evolve, and for example come back on some eearly design 
mistakes. 

Our envisionned solution to work around this issue is twofold:
  - The api will exclusively provide header files. 
  - The api will be distributed in a way that makes it embeddable in the client package. A client 
    package will consist on original code using headers of the api that will be stored somewhere 
    within the package
    
With these two design conditions, the version of the api used for a package is the same accross 
all scenarios. The version of the api used on the installed package of some user is the same
as the version of the api used by the cran package, which is also the same as the version of the 
api that has been used to develop the package. 

Ugrading to a newer version of the api becomes the responsability of the developper of the 
client package. This will dramatically reduce binary incompatibility issues. 

This distribution model gives developpers of the R/C++ api much more latitude to make 
potentially breaking changes, eliminate dead code or simply redesign parts of the api
that deserve it. 

Modularity
----------

Currently, when using `Rcpp`, we include all of the code base with `#include <Rcpp.h>`, 
this pulls in all of the code base, including api classes, sugar and modules. However 
sometimes only a limited fraction of the codebase is effectively used. For example
some code might only use numeric vectors. 

We will look at solutions allowing to extract only the relevant part of the api
for the target use. 

Code Complexity
---------------

Some classes in the current implementation of Rcpp suffer from the design as you go
pattern and expose an overly complicated api. For example, the vector classes
(e.g. `NumericVector`) have too many constructors. The constructors can avantageaously 
be replaced by appropriate free functions. 

Plan
====

TODO: detailed plan

Help requested
==============

I would like to ask for financial support to cover part of the time needed for the design and implementation 
of this modernized R/C++ api. 

TODO: once the plan is detailed, come up with a $ amount. 

Acknowledgements
================

I would like to thank my colleagues Diane Beldame and Vincent Guyader for allowing me to focus some of my work time
to this project and encouraging me to go forward with this proposal. 

Dissemination
============

The `rstats-cpp` organization has been created on github to host various artifacts from this initiative. Code and 
documentation will be continusouly uploaded to several repositories within this organization. 

The nature of the expected distribution of the code (i.e. embedding the api code inside the client package) 
requires careful selection of a licensing model. It has to be compatible with R package development
and values supported by the consortium. 

TODO: do we create a specific blog

TODO: articles in R journal (other ?). Blog post in the consortium blog.

About the author
===============

I have been trained as a statistician at the university in Montpellier, and ISUP in Paris. I have been 
professionally involved in the R community for more than 10 years, for Mango Solutions between 2006 and 2008, 
as a freelancer for 8 years, and as a Consulting Datactive for ThinkR since Feb 2017. 

My interest for connecting R and C++ is not new. I have been involved in the development of the current
solution, originally inspired from the design of `rJava` (Urbanek 2016). Most of the design principles
on which Rcpp is based now are a legacy of my work in the project between 2011. To this day, my contributions to 
`Rcpp` still represent more commits than the next two developpers. I am very proud of the work done and its adoption
by the community. I am also frustrated by some choices that were made, and my main reason for stepping down from the 
Rcpp core team is that its maintainership is centered on backwards compatibility whereas there is room for
(perhaps disruptive) innovation and redesign. 

Aside from my consulting and training responsabilities at ThinkR, I have a dedicated portion of my time 
devoted to the developpment of open source solutions. This project of modernization of the R/C++
interface is my top priority in that context. Support from the R Consortium will allow me to 
dedicate more time to the project, and/or hire extra hands. The nature and performance of the R language 
requires leveraging external compiled languages, C++ was and remains the best candidate and the 
R community deserves the very best design for a bridge between the two languages.
