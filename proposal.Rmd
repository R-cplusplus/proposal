Problem
=======

The success of `Rcpp` (Eddelbuettel and François 2011) is a great testimony of the need within the R 
community to have solid foundations to use R together with C++. A significant subset of R packages
use of Rcpp to leverage C++ code, and this extends to a large proportion of packages once
recursive reverse dependencies are taken into account. 

However ubiquitous, the current implementation of `Rcpp` is maintained with emphasis on interface stability 
and backwards compatibility against old versions of C++, namely `C++98`. Before the release of `C++11`, the language had been 
stagnant for a long period of time. Adoption of modern C++ standards (from `C++11`) by compiler providers has 
taken additional time, and availability of these compilers accross relevant platforms suitable for R development 
took further time. 

The completed modernization of the `Rtools` suite for windows set an important milestone about 
availability of modern C++ standards. When developping modern R packages using C++ code, we can now 
safely assume C++11. Furthermore, transitionning from C++11 to more recent versions should 
be less of a struggle. 

Backwards compatibility with C++98 may initially perceived as a good feature, but in effect it is
our belief that it is in fact a curse in disguise. It forces developpers of the R/C++ bridge as well 
as developpers to dependent packages to maintain code targetting both modern syntax (using features such as lambdas 
and the `auto` keyword) and outdated C++ idioms. In effect, this leads to conditionnal compiling and 
therefore code bloat.
